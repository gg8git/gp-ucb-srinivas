# gp-ucb-srinivas

This is an implementation of the GP-UCB algorithm from Srinivas et al. (2010), as well as an implementation of various other BO theory experiments.

## regret.py

Demonstrates GP-UCB theoretical bound.

## robust.py

Demonstrates robustness of GP-UCB method to lengthscale prior perturbations (as in Berkenkamp et al. (2019)).
